# Lab1_Anja_Scherwall_DE25

#### The instructions for this lab part 1:
- read the text file called dna_raw.txt
    - each sequene is composed of two lines of data: the first line beginning with > sign is the sequence ID, while the following line is the actual sequence
    - the actual sequence is not case-sensitive, which means that lower and upper case letters are treated the same

- for each sequence, create a dictionary to count the number of each DNA letter in that sequendce {'a' : x, 't' : x, 'c' : x, 'g' : x}
- for each sequence, graph the frequency of DNA letter for each sequence
